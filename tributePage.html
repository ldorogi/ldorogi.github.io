      <h2>Most important milestones of his life</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Was born in Budapest on 1st April 1927.
        </li>
        <li>
          He had already made his full debut for Kispest in the national football league’s top tier (NBI) in 1943.
        </li>
        <li>
          He had become a member of the national team at the age of 18 when he played – and scored – against Austria on 20th August 1945.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 1950 Ferenc Puskás married his wife, the-then 18-year-old Erzsébet Hunyadvári, and in 1952 their only child Anikó was born in Budapest.
        </li>
        <li>
          The ‘Golden Team’ captained by Puskás became famous around the world with its first success on 2nd August 1952 when it beat Yugoslavia 2-0 in the Olympic football final in Helsinki.
        </li>
        <li>
          On 25th November 1953 the Hungary national team destroyed their English hosts’ 90-year-old unbeaten record on home soil against countries outside the British Isles, thrashing them 6-3. Puskás scored twice.
        </li>
        <li>
          England asked for a return fixture in order to make amends, but half a year later in Budapest they were beaten even more heavily, Puskás again captaining the team and scoring twice but this time in a 7-1 victory for the Hungarian hosts...
        </li>
        <li>
          The Hungarian "Golden Team" won all its subsequent matches until the World Cup final. At the Wankdorf Stadium in Bern, Switzerland, on 4 July 1954, West Germany beat the heavily favoured Golden Team of Hungary 3–2.
        </li>
        <li>
          The 1956 uprising changed everything though; when Puskás and the rest of his Honvéd teammates left the country at the end of that November, they could not have thought that some of them would not return home for several decades.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the age of 31 he came to earn a place for himself in a Real Madrid team full of world stars. It is almost unbelievable that for ten more years he was able to stay as a world-class superstar in Europe’s most successful club.
        </li>
        <li>
          Due to the political dogma of the time he was not able to continue performing for the Hungary national team, but even today his statistic of 84 goals in 85 matches is still a world record.
        </li>
        <li>
          Puskás’ incredible goalscoring records were followed by newer feats even harder to eclipse; in the 1960 and 1962 European Cup finals he scored four and three goals respectively and after finishing top goalscorer four times in Hungarian league seasons he managed the feat four times in Spain too.
        </li>
        <li>
          As a coach as he travelled the world; he worked on every continent. He achieved his biggest success as coach of Panathinaikos when he took the-then almost amateur team to the final of the 1971 European Cup where they were only defeated by the outstanding team of the period, Ajax Amsterdam.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 1991 he moved home to Hungary permanently
        </li>
        <li>
          His health deteriorated soon after though, due to a particular strain of the Alzheimers disease which led to him living permanently in a hospital from the year 2000.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since 2002 the Népstadion has been renamed the Ferenc Puskás Stadium.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ferenc Puskás, the ‘National Sportsman’ who was the symbol of Hungarianness in the twentieth century, left us on 17th November 2006 to – as he himself put it – join up with the other national-team members up there.
